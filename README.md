# Swipe

## Project Requirements

- Will have to contain a stack of “cards” initially
    - Temporarily will use placeholder data in the form of a json file or something similar
- Store data as “cards”
    - Can perform actions on these cards through swiping (up, down, left, right)
    - Possible options for swipe commands listed below
        - A. Ability to move back and forth between cards
            - Up = Discard
            - Down = Save into invite list
            - Left = Previous card
            - Right = Next card
        - B. No ability to move back and forth between cards
            - Left = Discard
            - Right = Save into invite list
        - C. Add an undecided option
            - Left = Discard
            - Right = Save into invite List
            - Up/Down = Undecided
- Be able to see your list of saved cards
    - Potentially be able to further refine the list if necessary through swiping

## Extra Goals

- Animation for swiping
    - Card goes in the direction of the swipe
- Maybe an animation for flipping the card when tapping it
    - This would only be applicable if flipping the card to reveal more information about the person is important to the design of the project (i.e., more information about their background or accomplishments, etc. that would not fit on the first side)
- Any other UI improvements that may make the project look more visually appealing and intuitive for the user
    - Including but not limited to color choices, design decisions, etc…
